    <h2> The Path </h2>

<section id="right_section"><p> There is no real way to describe even half the things that go on. For inside this namelss hollow i have found that which i was not looking for.
There is no right way or wrong way and no directional guide to lead you on the path or lead you astray.
There is only the road that appears to be endless before you and the little you have to keep going.
There will be many trials upon the road less traveled but it will in turn make you stronger.But upon taking the easy path you will only find yourself broken in the end.

<h2>The Actor</h2>

<p>Someone must venture out to take the challenge ahead and for that person there will be no quarter.
    Steadfast is the dweller of this story lest death snatches them from the very text that gives them life.
    stricken from the pages and known for none other than a footer and nothing more.
    Swollen their ankles may be but there is no mercy given to either the protaganist or the antagonist but swift action delt for idiocy and pride. 
</p>

<h2>The Reader </h2>

<p>Creating the very foundaations for which we stand involves nothing but the belief that one is standing in this story.
    Control is key for each bit of text and characters are never any the wiser to it.
    Calculating the amount of danger necessary for our character to go against this control lies solely on the feelings of the reader.
    Concluding the story requires the reader to make a choice but for good or ill the choice matters not for the reader only need believe he stands to have choice.
